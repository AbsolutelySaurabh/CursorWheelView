# CursorWheelLayout

CursorWheelLayout is an Android library that allows view to be placed on a rotatable wheel. It behaves like a Circular ListView where items rotate rather than scroll vertically(but without view recycle strategy).
CursorWheelLayout consists of two components , the center item with id `id_wheel_menu_center_item` and the menu items that provided by CycleWheelAdapter.

The CursorWheelLayout can be used as a way to select one item from a list. The `wheelSelectedAngle` attribute determines what position on the wheel is selected.
You can also receive a callback for when an item is clicked, and whether it is selected. Have a look at the sample for a working example!
